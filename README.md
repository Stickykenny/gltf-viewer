Advices
Don't forget to run source .vscode/bash-init.sh to have access to utility command.
Download at least one test scene with get_sponza_sample or get_damaged_helmet_sample, or the whole package with clone_gltf_samples
Compile often (with cmake_build command)
Run often (with view_sponza or view_helmet commands)
Try to spot bugs early
Don't freak out: you should have a black screen until you finish "Loading and Drawing" section
